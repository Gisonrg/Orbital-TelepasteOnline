###Ideation###
**What is Telepaste?**

In a word: ***a powerful QR code utility app on modern platform.***

However, it is not that simple:

For years, people are always seeking a way of fast data exchange between devices. QR code is one of the popular choices these days. Thatâ€™s why we created Telepaste. It is a smart tool for users who want to exchange short text message like phone numbers or URLs in a fast and elegant way using QR codes.

Telepaste uses QR codes as a media. It is able to capture contents automatically from your clipboard and generate QR code before you open the app. You don't have to press any button to generate the code! Telepaste also supports auto-copying the decoded contents to the clipboard, which will make your life more convenient.

We are now trying to make it an all-platform-supported app.

**Liftoff slides and video?**

It seems that our group has changed our topic (Sorry - -!), so check the slides for team ***Undefined*** if it interests you.

**Typical Usage**

*Situation 1*

	Some one send you an URL on your iPhone: you want to open it on your laptop, but you find the URL is too long and complex to type.

*Solution*
	
	1. Copy the link on your phone.
	2. Open Telepaste.
	3. With the auto-generated QRcode, use the Telepate Website or the Macintosh client to scan the code.
	4. You have the link on your computer now. The link detection allows you to access the link with a single click. (Mac client)
	
*Situation 2*

	You make a new friend in a party, but the problem is, how to exchange your contact information in a fast and accurate way?

*Solution*
	
	1. Open Telepaste.
	2. Choose your contact details to generate the QRcode
	3. Scan each other's code.
	4. Invite him/her for dinner next time.

###Project Log###
**Timeline**

1. Web version prototype: by Milestone 1 ***(Currently in development)***
2. OSX version completed in Jun 18.
3. Web version Beta finished: By the end of June (around Milestone 2)
4. iOS version 2.0 prototyping and testing (around 10, July)
5. Web version and iOS version 2.0 Released. (around Milestone 3)

###Prototype and Summary###

####Web version####

For the first month, we mainly did some self-learning stuffs and finalized our idea. We decided to develop the web version for the Telepaste first. And in the past few days, we have developed a working prototype which now could scan QR code using laptop's camera. It needs your browser to support Flash, which is supported by most of modern browsers. 

We tried a Html 5 camera plugin but it doesn't support well for languages like Chinese and Japanese, as well as browsers like IE and Safari. In the next phase, we will finalize the beta version to make it a good QRcode app.

Here are some screen shoot for the prototype:
